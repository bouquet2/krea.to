I am a novice programmer, Linux and Windows System Administrator/DevOps Engineer and a Free Software advocate.

I build tools/general software aimed at the tinkerer.

I am the founder of Kreato Linux and i also made multiple smaller projects.

My hobbies include music, anime, retro computers, the usual geek stuff.
